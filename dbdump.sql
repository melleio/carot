Since vision relies on a partnership between the retina (where vision is initiated) and the brin (which processes the information sent by the retina), we carry out high resolution imaging on both structures. Adaptive Optics Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscopy (AO-SLO) is used to image the retina and a battery of structural and functional tests (including functional magnetic resonance imaging, fMRI) is used'),(44,16,22,'A critical mission of our center is to bring novel therapies to the affected patients.  We structured our center to facilitate translational research into clinical trials with speed and caution. We have collaborated on and assisted with developing multiple ocular gene therapy INDs, documents required by the FDA before initiating a clinical trial.  In particular, our collaborative work on Leber’s Congenital Amaurosis type 2 (LCA caused by RPE65 mutations) with the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) has resulted in the only Phase 3 gene therapy study currently underway in the world. '),(45,18,15,'Ours is truly a translational Center, which means that our studies start with the patient, and we aim to develop therapies through a combination of laboratory – based and clinical research. The data that we gather from the patients can guide us to identifying the source of the disease and ultimately a way to measure the effects of an experimental treatment.

We aim to develop optogenetic gene therapy as a treatment to restore vision in blind eyes. Vision would be brought to totally blind retinas by rendering the cells remaining in the retina (once the photoreceptors have deteriorated) light-sensitive. Optogenetic proteins have been identified in ancient bacteria and algae. These are light-gated ionic channels or pumps, which can be used to activate or inhibit neuronal activity upon light stimulation. They can be readily packaged in recombinant AAV particles. Proof-of-concept that light sensitivity can be restored to the retina using optogenetic therapy has been demonstrated using rodent models. We aim to optimize the various components of optogenetic therapy so that it can be tested in large animals and ultimately in humans who are completely blind.

Sensory neurons transduce physical signals (light, sound waves, molecules in the air) into electrical signals, and these are communicated between neurons.

The vision retina is her model system. Dr. Vardi addresses questions concerning the precise connections between neurons, both at the morphological and molecular levels. She figures out what information is being communicated by deciphering chemical released from a cell and the receptors which receive particular chemicals. The retina is used as a model system for signal processing because it has several advantages over centers in the brain. first, the input is well defined: it is the pattern of light and dark \"dots\" that falls on the retina. second, the output, which is carried out of the retina by ganglion cells, has been thoroughly studied. Third, the anatomy of the retinal is well studies both on the light and electron microscopic levels. the knowledge is so detailed that the number of synapses between specific cell type is known. Finally, the questions regarding signal processing are well defined: photoreceptors (through retinal circuits) transfer information to ganglion cells under a wide range of luminances, and they do it very reliably! To signal reliably, the retina has to employ gain control and noise removal mechanisms. the key question is: what is the molecular basis of these principal mechanisms? Dr. Vardi\'s work figuring out the chemical architecture of the circuit will decipher this question.</p>',NULL,NULL,1,1,29,0,0,NULL,'Inherit','Inherit',6,30),(69,'TeamMemberPage','2014-05-15 21:09:51','2014-05-24 14:46:03','ivan-shpylchak','Ivan Shpylchak',NULL,'<p class=\"p1\">Ivan Shpylchak, Animal Care Technician</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Ivan Shpylchak moved from the Ukraine to the USA to continue his studies and has applied his expertise to non-invasive studies of retinal disease in animal models.

Who can I contact to ﬁnd out more about your clinical studies?</h3>\n<p>If you are interested in participating in non-invasive imaging studies, <br>please contact Dr. Jessica Morgan (jwmorgan@mail.med.upenn.edu) or Manzar Ashtari (ashtari@email.chop.edu). If you are interested in participating in our clinical trials, please contact the coordinator listed on the relevant www.clinicaltrials.gov website.</p>\n<h3>8. How can I send clinical information to your team members?</h3>\n<p>Please send information by fax (215-573-7155) or mail: Dr. Jean Bennett, <br>University of Pennsylvania, 310 Stellar-Chance Labs; 422 Curie Blvd, <br>Philadelphia, PA 19104.</p>\n<h3>9.

She is currently a professor of neuroscience, University of Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Perception is an incredibly abstract and complicated brain function, which enables us to see the world through the filters of the sensory systems. Sensory neurons transduce physical signals (light, sound waves, molecules in the air) into electrical signals, and these are communicated between neurons. It is the ensemble of these neurons’ activity that is interpreted as a familiar face, a pleasant music, an obnoxious smell, etc. Neurons communicate by a variety of cellular and molecular mechanisms whose principals and details Neuroscience is seeking. </p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Dr. Vardi deciphers some of the principal mechanisms of perception, a brain function which enables us to see the world through the filters of the sensory systems. The vision retina is her model system. Dr. Vardi addresses questions concerning the precise connections between neurons, both at the morphological and molecular levels. She figures out what information is being communicated by deciphering chemical released from a cell and the receptors which receive particular chemicals. The retina is used as a model system for signal processing because it has several advantages over centers in the brain. first, the input is well defined: it is the pattern of light and dark \"dots\" that falls on the retina. second, the output, which is carried out of the retina by ganglion cells, has been thoroughly studied. Third, the anatomy of the retinal is well studies both on the light and electron microscopic levels. the knowledge is so detailed that the number of synapses between specific cell type is known. Finally, the questions regarding signal processing are well defined: photoreceptors (through retinal circuits) transfer information to ganglion cells under a wide range of luminances, and they do it very reliably! To signal reliably, the retina has to employ gain control and noise removal mechanisms. the key question is: what is the molecular basis of these principal mechanisms? Dr. Vardi\'s work figuring out the chemical architecture of the circuit will decipher this question.</p>',NULL,NULL,1,1,29,0,0,NULL,'Inherit','Inherit',6,30),(69,'TeamMemberPage','2014-05-15 21:09:51','2014-05-24 14:46:03','ivan-shpylchak','Ivan Shpylchak',NULL,'<p class=\"p1\">Ivan Shpylchak, Animal Care Technician</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Ivan Shpylchak moved from the Ukraine to the USA to continue his studies and has applied his expertise to non-invasive studies of retinal disease in animal models.

This is <br>barring any unanticipated regulatory delays.</p>\n<h3>2. How will you decide which patients to enroll in the choroideremia clinical trial?</h3>\n<p>The subjects will need to have had genetic testing which identiﬁes a <br>disease-causing DNA change in the choroideremia gene. Otherwise, there <br>will be no chance of beneﬁt. Genetic testing can be carried out on a <br>blood sample. In addition, subjects will need to meet the inclusion <br>characteristics of the study (pending evaluation by local and federal <br>regulatory authorities).</p>\n<h3>3. How can I help push forward a clinical trial for my condition?</h3>\n<p><br>Network with patient advocate groups relevant to your condition, such as <br>Foundation Fighting Blindness, Choroideremia Research Foundation, <br>Foundation for Retinal Research; Assist in fundraising efforts to support <br>the research and clinical trials.</p>\n<h3><br>4. What can a person do if they are diagnosed with a retinal degenerative disease?</h3>\n<p><br>Undergo evaluations with a retinal degeneration specialist. Obtain <br>appropriate genetic testing to identify the cause of the condition. Obtain <br>up-to-date information and support from patient advocate organizations <br>(see above). Volunteer for clinical research studies if appropriate for your <br>condition and if you agree to assume the potential risks.</p>\n<h3><br>5. Is there any cost for participating in a clinical trial?</h3>\n<p><br>There are no charges for participating in our clinical trials. Travel, <br>lodging and food costs are covered, including those of an accompanying <br>person. There are no charges for the clinical testing or intervention.</p>\n<h3><br>6. Are your clinical trial subjects only from Pennsylvania?</h3>\n<p><br>No. While it can be easier on the subject/family to live in the vicinity <br>since there may be signiﬁcant travel obligations, we do not have <br>limitations based on citizenship or homeland.</p>\n<h3>7. Who can I contact to ﬁnd out more about your clinical studies?</h3>\n<p>If you are interested in participating in non-invasive imaging studies, <br>please contact Dr. Jessica Morgan (jwmorgan@mail.med.upenn.edu) or Manzar Ashtari (ashtari@email.chop.edu). If you are interested in participating in our clinical trials, please contact the coordinator listed on the relevant www.clinicaltrials.gov website.</p>\n<h3>8.

Using these protocols, we have demonstrated that subjects in the <a href=\"[sitetree_link,id=15]\">LCA-RPE65</a> gene therapy study gained dramatic improvement in their retinal function as assessed by cortical responses of the brain. It was heretofore unknown whether the circuitry connecting the retina and the brain could be reactivated after retinal gene therapy. We also used this approach to show that additional benefit could result after re-administration of gene therapy to the contralateral eye in subjects who had previously had received unilateral gene therapy. We have demonstrated a heretofore unappreciated plasticity of the central nervous system with respect to restoration of vision.</p>\n</div>',NULL,NULL,1,1,2,0,0,NULL,'Inherit','Inherit',14,18);

translational development, and the clinician/patient communities.  With a solid foundation in clinically relevant ocular research, CAROT will position itself as a global premiere center for translating novel bench research, such as gene and cell therapies, into the clinics and the market. The center will strive to foster nascent projects through various stages of clinical development.

Loss of sight dramatically distorts an individual’s interaction with the physical and social environment, leading to significant co-morbidity, reduced mobility and mental isolation. The affected population is large with an estimated 3 million Americans completely blind due to retinal disorders. The burden on the health care system is substantial, as is the societal burden. We aim to develop optogenetic gene therapy as a treatment to restore vision in blind eyes. Vision would be brought to totally blind retinas by rendering the cells remaining in the retina (once the photoreceptors have deteriorated) light-sensitive. Optogenetic proteins have been identified in ancient bacteria and algae. These are light-gated ionic channels or pumps, which can be used to activate or inhibit neuronal activity upon light stimulation. They can be readily packaged in recombinant AAV particles. Proof-of-concept that light sensitivity can be restored to the retina using optogenetic therapy has been demonstrated using rodent models. We aim to optimize the various components of optogenetic therapy so that it can be tested in large animals and ultimately in humans who are completely blind. We are carrying out optogenetic gene therapy studies as an international collaboration with individuals in Europe (Drs. Sahel, Roska, Picaud, Cronin, Bamberg) and in the USA (Drs.

Degeneration of macular cells causes loss of central vision and thus fine visual discrimination (the ability to read, recognize faces) and impairs color vision. Stargardt disease is caused by autosomal recessive mutations in a gene called ATPase Binding Cassette Retina (ABCR, ABCA4). ABCA4 mutations can also result in related conditions such as cone-rod dystrophy, fundus flavimaculatus and may contribute to disease in some forms of age-related macular degeneration. Like LCA-CEP290, the ABCA4 gene is large and surpasses the limited cargo capacity of recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV0 vectors). Our team is testing alternative approaches for delivering the wild type ABCA4 cDNA to photoreceptors both in vitro and in vivo. Concurrent with development of a gene-based approach for treating Stargardt disease (and/or cone-rod dystrophy), non-invasive studies in progress aim to characterize genotype:phenotype relationships in patients with this condition.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"> </p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">References:</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">1.

CEP290 is a protein associated with cilia, structures that are present throughout the body, including photoreceptors, which are modified cilia. Depending on the nature of the CEP290 mutation, individuals can also suffer disease in other tissues. LCA-CEP290 is an attractive target for gene therapy because of its relative prevalence, however there are technical challenges to delivering the wild type gene due to its large size. Our team has been studying the biology of this gene / protein<sup>1</sup> with the goal of using this information to develop gene-based approaches for treatment.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">References:</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">1.

Loss of sight dramatically distorts an individual’s interaction with the physical and social environment, leading to significant co-morbidity, reduced mobility and mental isolation. The affected population is large with an estimated 3 million Americans completely blind due to retinal disorders. The burden on the health care system is substantial, as is the societal burden. We aim to develop optogenetic gene therapy as a treatment to restore vision in blind eyes. Vision would be brought to totally blind retinas by rendering the cells remaining in the retina (once the photoreceptors have deteriorated) light-sensitive. Optogenetic proteins have been identified in ancient bacteria and algae. These are light-gated ionic channels or pumps, which can be used to activate or inhibit neuronal activity upon light stimulation. They can be readily packaged in recombinant AAV particles. Proof-of-concept that light sensitivity can be restored to the retina using optogenetic therapy has been demonstrated using rodent models. We aim to optimize the various components of optogenetic therapy so that it can be tested in large animals and ultimately in humans who are completely blind.

Loss of sight dramatically distorts an individual’s interaction with the physical and social environment, leading to significant co-morbidity, reduced mobility and mental isolation. The affected population is large with an estimated 3 million Americans completely blind due to retinal disorders. The burden on the health care system is substantial, as is the societal burden. We aim to develop optogenetic gene therapy as a treatment to restore vision in blind eyes. Vision would be brought to totally blind retinas by rendering the cells remaining in the retina (once the photoreceptors have deteriorated) light-sensitive. Optogenetic proteins have been identified in ancient bacteria and algae. These are light-gated ionic channels or pumps, which can be used to activate or inhibit neuronal activity upon light stimulation. They can be readily packaged in recombinant AAV particles. Proof-of-concept that light sensitivity can be restored to the retina using optogenetic therapy has been demonstrated using rodent models. We aim to optimize the various components of optogenetic therapy so that it can be tested in large animals and ultimately in humans who are completely blind.

the past two decades. Jean received her B.S. in Honors Biology from Yale University in 1976 and her Ph.D. in 1980 in Zoology and Cell and Developmental Biology at the University of California, Berkeley. After a fellowship in Anatomy, Radiobiology and Environmental Health at UCSF (which involved a collaboration in the newly developing field of gene therapy), she received her M.D. in 1986 from Harvard Medical School.  Jean carried out a fellowship in Human Genetics at Yale University School of Medicine and in Developmental Genetics at the Johns Hopkins Medical Institution. The goals of Jean’s research program are to improve our understanding of the molecular bases of and to develop therapies for inherited retinal degenerations. She works closely with her husband, Albert M. Maguire, MD, a vitreo-retinal surgeon at UPenn, on this research. Their research has established the scientific underpinnings which made possible to test the first potential definitive retinal gene therapy treatment for patients with blinding retinal degenerations. In her free time, Jean enjoys playing the piano, raising honeybees, playing with her dogs (former patients in gene therapy studies), and farming.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"> </p>',NULL,NULL,1,1,1,0,0,NULL,'Inherit','Inherit',30),(257,71,1,1,2,2,'ForumHolder','2014-05-16 18:17:10','2014-05-16 18:17:10','forums','Forums',NULL,'<p>Welcome to SilverStripe Forum Module!

Sensory neurons transduce physical signals (light, sound waves, molecules in the air) into electrical signals, and these are communicated between neurons.

She figures out what information is being communicated by deciphering chemical released from a cell and the receptors which receive particular chemicals. The retina is used as a model system for signal processing because it has several advantages over centers in the brain. first, the input is well defined: it is the pattern of light and dark \"dots\" that falls on the retina. second, the output, which is carried out of the retina by ganglion cells, has been thoroughly studied. Third, the anatomy of the retinal is well studies both on the light and electron microscopic levels. the knowledge is so detailed that the number of synapses between specific cell type is known. Finally, the questions regarding signal processing are well defined: photoreceptors (through retinal circuits) transfer information to ganglion cells under a wide range of luminances, and they do it very reliably! To signal reliably, the retina has to employ gain control and noise removal mechanisms. the key question is: what is the molecular basis of these principal mechanisms?

We and others have demonstrated that this is possible in Leber’s Congenital Amaurosis (LCA) caused by RPE65 mutations. We carried out proof-of concept studies in animals born blind to this condition and showed that vision could be restored by gene augmentation therapy. With our partners at The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), we demonstrated that vision could also be restored in children and young adults with this disease.

Depending on the nature of the CEP290 mutation, individuals can also suffer disease in other tissues. LCA-CEP290 is an attractive target for gene therapy because of its relative prevalence, however there are technical challenges to delivering the wild type gene due to its large size.

Degeneration of macular cells causes loss of central vision and thus fine visual discrimination (the ability to read, recognize faces) and impairs color vision. Stargardt disease is caused by autosomal recessive mutations in a gene called ATPase Binding Cassette Retina (ABCR, ABCA4). ABCA4 mutations can also result in related conditions such as cone-rod dystrophy, fundus flavimaculatus and may contribute to disease in some forms of age-related macular degeneration. Like LCA-CEP290, the ABCA4 gene is large and surpasses the limited cargo capacity of recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV0 vectors). Our team is testing alternative approaches for delivering the wild type ABCA4 cDNA to photoreceptors both in vitro and in vivo. Concurrent with development of a gene-based approach for treating Stargardt disease (and/or cone-rod dystrophy), non-invasive studies in progress aim to characterize genotype:phenotype relationships in patients with this condition.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"> </p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">References:</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">1.

Degeneration of macular cells causes loss of central vision and thus fine visual discrimination (the ability to read, recognize faces) and impairs color vision. Stargardt disease is caused by autosomal recessive mutations in a gene called ATPase Binding Cassette Retina (ABCR, ABCA4). ABCA4 mutations can also result in related conditions such as cone-rod dystrophy, fundus flavimaculatus and may contribute to disease in some forms of age-related macular degeneration.

Sensory neurons transduce physical signals (light, sound waves, molecules in the air) into electrical signals, and these are communicated between neurons. It is the ensemble of these neurons’ activity that is interpreted as a familiar face, a pleasant music, an obnoxious smell, etc. Neurons communicate by a variety of cellular and molecular mechanisms whose principals and details Neuroscience is seeking. </p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Dr. VARDI decipherS some of the principal mechanisms of perception, a brain function which enables us to see the world through the filters of the sensory systems.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">the visual retina is her model system. Dr. Vardi addresses questions concerning the precise connections between neurons, both at the morphological and molecular levels. She figures out what information is being communicated by deciphering chemical released from a cell and the receptors which receive particular chemicals. The retina is used as a model system for signal processing because it has several advantages over centers in the brain. first, the input is well defined: it is the pattern of light and dark \"dots\" that falls on the retina. second, the output, which is carried out of the retina by ganglion cells, has been thoroughly studied. Third, the anatomy of the retinal is well studies both on the light and electron microscopic levels. the knowledge is so detailed that the number of synapses between specific cell type is known. Finally, the questions regarding signal processing are well defined: photoreceptors (through retinal circuits) transfer information to ganglion cells under a wide range of luminances, and they do it very reliably! To signal reliably, the retina has to employ gain control and noise removal mechanisms. the key question is: what is the molecular basis of these principal mechanisms? Dr. Vardi\'s work figuring out the chemical architecture of the circuit will decipher this question.</p>',NULL,NULL,1,1,29,0,0,NULL,'Inherit','Inherit',30),(394,69,4,1,2,2,'TeamMemberPage','2014-05-15 21:09:51','2014-05-24 14:46:03','ivan-shpylchak','Ivan Shpylchak',NULL,'<p class=\"p1\">Ivan Shpylchak, Animal Care Technician</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Ivan Shpylchak moved from the Ukraine to the USA to continue his studies and has applied his expertise to non-invasive studies of retinal disease in animal models.

ABCA4 mutations can also result in related conditions such as cone-rod dystrophy, fundus flavimaculatus and may contribute to disease in some forms of age-related macular degeneration. Like LCA-CEP290, the ABCA4 gene is large and surpasses the limited cargo capacity of recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV vectors).

This is particularly important when appropriate animal models are not practical or available.  Recently, advances have been made that allowed differentiation of human iPSC into photoreceptors and their nurse cells, the retinal-pigmented epithelium (RPE).  Part of the Scheie Eye Institute, CAROT has the capability to bank cells from patients seen in our clinics with inherited retinal degenerations, and establish a valuable biobank which can be used to identify new disease genes as well as to create iPSC that can be used to model a large set of orphan diseases.  At CAROT, we have used patient-derived iPSC to provide proof of concept data for gene augmentation therapy for Choroideremia, an X-linked recessive retinal disease caused by mutation and loss of function of CHM which encodes Rab Escort Protein<sup>1</sup>. Thus, the ability of CAROT to create a biobank of cells from patients with inherited retinal degenerations and to generate patient-specific models would open the door to a personalized approach to understanding and treating inherited retinal degenerations.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell Core is directed by <a href=\"[sitetree_link,id=34]\">Jeannette Bennicelli</a>. </p>',NULL,NULL,1,1,4,0,0,NULL,'Inherit','Inherit',20),(468,22,8,1,3,3,'LaboratoryResearchItem','2014-05-08 00:33:04','2014-05-31 00:55:57','adeno-associated-virus-and-retinal-gene-transfer','Adeno-Associated Virus & Retinal Gene Transfer',NULL,'<p class=\"p1\">Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV) is a non-pathogenic, single-stranded DNA genome-containing, helper virus-dependent member of the parvovirus family.

AAV2 is the serotype that is being used in clinical trials for Leber\'s Congenital Amaurosis (LCA) due to RPE65 mutations, Choroideremia and age-related macular degeneration. Subretinal delivery of AAV2 appears to be safe using the doses that have been tested to date, and there are signs of efficacy in the studies of LCA. Members of CAROT have played key roles in carrying out the preclinical safety and efficacy studies and designing and carrying out the clinical trials for LCA-RPE65 that are taking place at the Children\'s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP).  CAROT is also carrying out the preclinical studies necessary to use AAV2 to launch gene therapy clinical trials for Choroideremia and other diseases.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While AAV2 appears useful and safe, there may be other AAV serotypes which will expand opportunities for targeting additional retinal diseases.

Depending on the nature of the CEP290 mutation, individuals can also suffer disease in other tissues. LCA-CEP290 is an attractive target for gene therapy because of its relative prevalence, however there are technical challenges to delivering the wild type gene due to its large size.

The data that we gather from the patients can guide us to identifying the source of the disease and ultimately a way to measure the effects of an experimental treatment. Therefore, we carry out a number of non-invasive IRB-approved, human studies. The studies include standard clinical testing (such as visual acuity, visual field, light sensitivity testing), as well as high resolution imaging. Since vision relies on a partnership between the retina (where vision is initiated) and the brain (which processes the information sent by the retina), we carry out high resolution imaging on both structures.

This is <br>barring any unanticipated regulatory delays.</p>\n<h3>2. How will you decide which patients to enroll in the choroideremia clinical trial?</h3>\n<p>The subjects will need to have had genetic testing which identiﬁes a <br>disease-causing DNA change in the choroideremia gene. Otherwise, there <br>will be no chance of beneﬁt. Genetic testing can be carried out on a <br>blood sample. In addition, subjects will need to meet the inclusion <br>characteristics of the study (pending evaluation by local and federal <br>regulatory authorities).</p>\n<h3>3. How can I help push forward a clinical trial for my condition?</h3>\n<p><br>Network with patient advocate groups relevant to your condition, such as <br>Foundation Fighting Blindness, Choroideremia Research Foundation, <br>Foundation for Retinal Research; Assist in fundraising efforts to support <br>the research and clinical trials.</p>\n<h3><br>4. What can a person do if they are diagnosed with a retinal degenerative disease?</h3>\n<p><br>Undergo evaluations with a retinal degeneration specialist. Obtain <br>appropriate genetic testing to identify the cause of the condition. Obtain <br>up-to-date information and support from patient advocate organizations <br>(see above). Volunteer for clinical research studies if appropriate for your <br>condition and if you agree to assume the potential risks.</p>\n<h3><br>5. Is there any cost for participating in a clinical trial?</h3>\n<p><br>There are no charges for participating in our clinical trials. Travel, <br>lodging and food costs are covered, including those of an accompanying <br>person. There are no charges for the clinical testing or intervention.</p>\n<h3><br>6. Are your clinical trial subjects only from Pennsylvania?</h3>\n<p><br>No. While it can be easier on the subject/family to live in the vicinity <br>since there may be signiﬁcant travel obligations, we do not have <br>limitations based on citizenship or homeland.</p>\n<h3>7. Who can I contact to ﬁnd out more about your clinical studies?</h3>\n<p>If you are interested in participating in non-invasive imaging studies, <br>please contact Dr. Jessica Morgan (jwmorgan@mail.med.upenn.edu) or Manzar Ashtari (ashtari@email.chop.edu). If you are interested in participating in our clinical trials, please contact the coordinator listed on the relevant www.clinicaltrials.gov website.</p>\n<h3>8. How can I send clinical information to your team members?</h3>\n<p>Please send information by fax (215-573-7155) or mail: Dr. Jean Bennett, <br>University of Pennsylvania, 310 Stellar-Chance Labs; 422 Curie Blvd, <br>Philadelphia, PA 19104.</p>\n<h3>9.

In such instances it may be possible to deliver normal copies of the disease-causing gene to the affected cells. We and others have demonstrated that this is possible in Leber’s Congenital Amaurosis (LCA) caused by RPE65 mutations. We carried out proof-of concept studies in animals born blind to this condition and showed that vision could be restored by gene augmentation therapy. With our partners at The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), we demonstrated that vision could also be restored in children and young adults with this disease. Children who, before treatment, were dependent on blind canes for navigation are now able to walk independently and participate in regular school (and extracurricular) activities. </p>\n<p class=\"p1\">We also showed that in LCA-RPE65, gene therapy could be re-administered safely to the contralateral eye. The goal now is to extrapolate the gene augmentation approach to other genetic causes of blindness. CAROT has demonstrated proof-of–concept of gene therapy for Choroideremia, an X-linked condition (and thus affecting boys and men). </p>\n<p class=\"p2\"> CAROT has been working with investigators at CHOP to plan a clinical trial for Choroideremia (estimated start date is October 2014). CAROT also has gene therapy paradigms for half a dozen other blinding diseases in the pipeline, including other forms of LCA (forms caused by CEP290, RDH12 and Lebercilin mutations and also a form of macular degeneration, Stargardt disease.) Our successes in both bench and clinical research make us a truly translational center.</p>',NULL,NULL,1,1,1,0,0,NULL,'Inherit','Inherit',20);
