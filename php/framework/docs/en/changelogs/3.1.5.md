# 3.1.5

## Upgrading

 * If running an application in an environment where user security is critical, it may be necessary to
   assign the config value `Security.remember_username` to false. This will disable persistence of
   user login name between sessions, and disable browser auto-completion on the username field.
   Note that users of certain browsers who have previously autofilled and saved login credentials
   will need to clear their password autofill history before this setting is properly respected.
